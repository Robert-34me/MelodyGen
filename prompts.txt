dark synthwave beat in the style of Mr Kitty - After Dark
a powerful and aggressive rock song with heavy guitars, driving drums, and intense vocals. Think dark and gothic with elements of electronic distortion. Keywords: heavy, intense, monster, darknes.
[Instrumental] Dreamy synthwave, retro pop vibes, Valerie-esque vocals, female vocalist, breathy, echoing. Lyrics: My heart beats like a drum, addicted to your love, you're my only drug. [Chorus] Your love is my drug, I can't get enough, you're my everything. [Outro] Fading synth, lingering vocals.
Happy ukulele music, positive and bright
